1,4.5,  Their biriyani is something to die for. I will never mind traveling for miles to eat meghanas special biriyani. It has always been my favorite biriyani place till date. The place is okay and they have limited seating so the wait is longer. But it's worth it.
2,5,"  “boneless biriyani “ Whenever I hear this name, the only place which comes to my mind is Meghanas. #enoughsaid The ambience is not great in kormangla branch. It is very cluttered"
3,5,  The biryanis here come under the top 5 in bangalore for sure. Needless to say that most customers i saw were ordering the same Would certainly recommend a visit for avid biryani fans.
4,4,  Ordered chicken biryani and Guntur chicken and the food was really good. The salan and raita were not good and can be worked upon for improvement. The Staffs are really good and helpful
5,5,"  Always I highly recommend this place for biriyani.., it's an Sooo juicy and lovely rice with more aromatic flavors some spices added it's gives us more attention to have biriyani., I love this place"
6,4,"  Been to Bangalore for a small trip and really afraid about the taste of food I am gonna get in Bangalore, then found this shop I ordered mutton biriyani along with chicken 65 , the taste is really good.. really satisfactory.. really happy"
7,4,  Visited this place on an afternoon with my parents after writing the COMED K exam. Had heard a lot about this place and the reviews on zomato increased my cravings for the biryani at this place to a higher level. The order was simple 1) MEGHANA SPECIAL BIRYANI : This chicken biryani is served in a huge quantity and the taste is just brilliant. By far this is the top biryani ever tasted by me in a restaurant. This is the first time I saw a biryani being served with the pieces served on the top of the rice. The quantity is humongous. If you are a newbie to the Meghana’s franchise then just go for this biryani. 2) Meghana’s Paneer Biryani : This was very good indeed. As it’s known to all non veg lovers that veg biryani doesn’t exist and so called biryani is a pulao. But wait this is no pulao. This is a delicious paneer BIRYANI. And probably the best biryani for vegetarians too. And once again the quantity is humongous. 3) Prawn starter which was that day’s special : This was actually small prawns which was cooked very well. The quantity was also very good. Though slightly on the pricy side one would never regret paying the bill. All in all I will recommend this place. Interesting fact : This place is loved by both non vegetarians and vegetarians.
8,4,"  Who doesn’t know about meghana in Bangalore! If you love rice and spice, this is the place to go for their scrumptious biryani! I especially love their boneless chicken biryani. The chicken is cut into small pieces, very well marinated and spiced and is topped onto the flavourful biryani rice. For someone like me who isn’t fond of the big bland white pieces of chicken, this is the perfect treat! Have also tried the dum aloo biryani, and multiple starters: everything is delicious. The only bummer is it’s always full and you need to wait to get a table anytime. Not very fond of the ambience - nothing great or bad about it though."
9,4,  Out right one of the best chicken biryani I've had with no compromise on the taste in a take away ! MUST have meghanas special chicken biryani...it's delicious !!
10,5,"  Boneless chicken biryani... Recommended Bit spicy, but chicken masala will be too good. Rice and chicken gravy will be seperately served. Enough for 2 people... Worth for money"
11,4,"  Meghanas was a favourite haunt for those of us who studied in Christ for their delectable Meghana Special Chicken Biryani. The boneless biryani is full of flavour and the portions are huge. I’ve on occasion tried their paneer biryani, chicken 65, mutton pepper fry and chicken kebabs as well and all of the above taste good. But what takes me back to this popular food haunt every time I visit bangalore is their yummy full of goodness biryani."
12,4,"  A decent small place located between all the hustle and bustle of Koramangala. All of my friends from North are a crazy fan of the Biryanis served here. Top favourites amongst the Biryani: Chicken boneless biryani, aloo dum biryani, Prawns Biryani For starter you should definitely try chilly fish, prawns fry and mutton pepper fry. Always crowded, shows the demand the place has! Overall Experience: Taste:4/5 Ambience:4/5 Value for money:4/5"
13,4,"  A small place which serves food till late in the night. So if you were partying hard and forgot to order food it is the place for you. We ordered a home delivery of Paneer 65 and Chilli paneer in starters. Super spicy but quite tasty. Good quality and tastes good even when cold. Veg biryani - The best veg biryani I have tasted till date. Long grained rice with flavourful veggie gravy. They pack the rice and veggies separately and you have to mix it at home. They also provide extra gravy and raita but the biryani tastes great even by itself. The large potato chunks in the biryani is delicious. Though I am a vegetarian, my friends who tried the chicken biryani tell me that there is no difference between the veg and chicken biryani except for the chicken which is a rarity. Going to go here for biryani again and again. Totally recommended."
14,5,"  Meghana foods , this particular restaurant has one of the best Andhra style food in this city . As a pure vegetarian i just love the Allu Dum biryani , phulka with paneer butter masala & Green peas curry. And dont forget about the starter’s they do make it spicy . For people who love andhra foods its a must try restaurant , this place will be crowded make sure you book a table or you have to wait in que. food - 5/5 Ambiance - 4.5/5 Service - 4/5"
15,4,"  Even though m sick of having rice daily from the day i came to bangalore, i went to this place. Famous for biryani, and i got to know why it is famous. Tried meghana special and paneer biryani and trust me both were really good. Served with gravy and raita. In starters we took paneer 65, it was spicy and tangy."
16,4,"  Best place for biriyani in Bangalore. Ordered two biriyani and two appetizers for four people and we kinda struggled to finish it. The Paneer biriyani costed more than the special chicken biriyani , but both were really good. The only disappointment was the chilli fish, it tasted very very average."
17,4,"  One of the famous and busiest tasty n spicy biryani outlet located in Koramangala. Had ordered the two Favourite Starters, Royal chicken and Dragon Chicken. Both were too delicious and a must try. Biryani Ordered - chicken boneless briyani and kheema biryani. People feel the biryani is too spicy but its fine once a while to have. The quantity is too much for one person. Staff are very quick and friendly."
18,5,  I had ordered food from this place via some delivery app. Every item was tasty and perfectly cooked as it should be. Would love to visit this place for more Veg items. Biriyani's are always great here with quite good quantity. I am in love with Dum Biriyani. Note: You people are giving real life to biriyanis in this town :)
19,4,"  I had gone to this place on a Saturday afternoon and had their special biryani. To be very frank it was just, there was nothing so special about it. And the ambiance of the place was not good. I would really not recommend this place , but if you have no other option then you can try this."
20,2,  I am usually a big fan of Ambur biriyani . Heard a lot about this place . Tried both their outlets in Koramangala and Residency Road . We ordered for one Chinese starter and one South Indian starter . Both the starters were fully consumed . Biriyani was unique and amazing in taste. The meat in the biriyani was so tender . Will surely visit again . This place is very crowded during weekends. Early walkin can save you .
21,5,"  Meghana...the name is a synonym for delicious biryani. Mutton pepper fry is also a must try. And if u r a fish lover, then fish fry also will not disappoint u. One portion biryani is good enough for two, so quantity is also fulfilling. The seating in kormangala location is below par which can be improved. The place is well within budget and must visit for biryani lovers."
22,4,  Every time I crave for Biryani I know where I have to go. Meghana’s chicken biryani is really tasty and I’ve had it ‘n’ number of times. Still I can have it many more times. My all time good to go place whenever I am hungry!!
23,4,"  I think people would really enjoy the non-veg biryanis here... I went to find a very specific taste for Biryani that I have been looking all over Bengaluru but couldn't find it here as well... Having said that, the food is definitely delicious. The serving is also sufficient for a single person."
24,4,"  Cult place for Biriyani lovers. Simple and fast service. The Aloo Dum, Paneer chicken and Boneless chicken varieties are all great. The gravy is the big plus for me. I didn't like their roti based items much. Stick to the Biriyani and starters!"
25,4,  Ordered the chicken Biriyani from Meghana foods. The chicken in the Biriyani was cooked oozing perfection. The meat was so tender and the masala was amazing. The rice was so aromatic and delightful to consume. Overall I can say good food for the soul. One of the best biriyanis in the top of my list
26,4,  Had a chance to be here to try the biriyani here. Heard a lot about it. Ambience is normal. Delivery is superb. There are a lot of staffs who take care of you. Biriyani was good. I liked the same biriyani in marathalli outlet more. Chicken starter was good but pieces may have been a lot softer. Overall a good experience and biriyani in Meghna is one of the best.
27,3,"Rated  I never expected this from Meghana given I am such a regular customer. I used one of the delivery apps to have one order of Boneless Chicken Biryani delivered. Now I had already been trying for close to an hour but the restaurant seemed to be ""closed"" for online ordering on any website till almost 2 p.m. Now the delivery app suggested the next delivery slot to be between 3:15 and 3:45 p.m. which I was still okay with since the food quality is always consistent with Meghana. This time, however, I was wrong. The long grained biryani rice was only 10% of the quantity while the rest was of a lower quality. The gravy which is always thick was watered down. The Boneless Chicken pieces were hard to chew. Now I have no idea if the timing had anything to do with the inferior treatment meted out to my order but I will be careful from now on about the timing at which the delivery takes place."
28,3,"  The place is for casual dinner days. Don’t feel like cooking food today, head to this economic restaurant. The chicken biryani offered is delicious and enough for two. Caution : the place remains crowded most of the times due to high demand."
29,4,"  Ordered Boneless Chicken Biryani and Fresh Lime Soda. Service was quick and staff was courteous. The Biryani's taste was decent, though I have had better tasting biryani at Bikkgane Biryani in Delhi. Salan and Raita were excellent. Overall, a nice restaurant for Andhra style biryani. Cheers!"
30,4,"d  It was a firday afternoon, and we all are in weekend mood... so suddenly we decided to have a special lunch.... and went to Meghana... it is a hyderabad style restaurant..... The food was more than average when compared to other hyderabadi restaurant and authenticity.... taste can be little better.... There is no A/C so if it is crowded you might feel hot.... Overall experience was good...??"
31,3,  Had placed an order for Meghana Special Biriyani few days ago and had placed a special request on Zomato to make it as per my choice. But they didn't even accept the request. Food was real bad. Not recommended to people who love biriyani. Food was good at other outlet of Megana foods near MG Road.
32,1,"  Just name is enough. I like it's spicy, hot biryani topped with chicken pieces fried with spices. Authentic. Quantity is also good, fulfilling. Waiting for your turn is somewhat annoying, but the food is worth the wait."
33,4,  Meghana's need no introduction to Bangloreans. Prompt service. Excellent taste. Reasonable price - Value for money. Enough quantity to fill stomach of two and quality isn't compromised. Good options of starters. The plating can be an issue there should be option on half plate/full plate for kebabs. Kebabs and chicken 65 are yummilicious. The biryani was hot and spicy just like the way I like it. Deb Debasis
34,5,"  One of the best Biryani Outlets in Bangalore. Located in one of the busiest places in Koramangala, it is a must go place for Biryani lovers. Being a vegetarian, found both the Veg Biryanis (Dum Aalo and Paneer) extremely delicious. Non-Veg Biryanis are amazing too (Courtesy: Friends) Accompany your Biryani with one of the Beverages and you are set for a wonderful tummy treat. Haven't tried their veg curries yet. PS: Expect a waiting time here. Food: 5/5 Ambience: 4/5 Service: 5/5"
35,5,"  Came here for the boneless chicken biryani. Wonderful as always. One biriyani will serve two people. It's super tasty, one of the best in town though I heard that it used to be much tastier before. The service was prompt and the staff was polite. Will surely have biriyani from here again."
36,4,  As usual great biryani. However this time there was more rice less masala. Chicken pieces were good. Worth the price we r paying for the quantity. However nvr got chance to taste any other stuff.
37,4,"  Been here more than 10 times in last one year and hence I can say, this place serves best biryani in Bangalore. Their Biryani never disappoints in any way and their starters are also worth ordering. Staff is courteous and professional. Ambience is decent and this place is mostly visited by college students. Rates are reasonable and service is up to the mark."
38,4,  People who love spicy and Hyderabad biryani this would be the best place in the town there have many branches across Bangalore but this one is near to my place they are highly recommended
39,4,  Food-4.5/5 They just have amazing biryani. I love spicy food and it’s just perfect. I would recommend everybody to this place if you love Biryani. Ambience-2.5/5 Don’t expect anything from this place in terms of ambience. It’s a small and clean(which is important). Price-Totally worth the price. Would defied visit again. Shourya3004
40,4,"  Meghanas need no introduction to Bangaloreans, their biryanis offer good variety and wholesome spicy taste. If u r not used to spicy food, u may not enjoy much. But, for some body who like hot food, the biryani is just perfect. With the right kind of spices and prep. Service is prompt. Nothing much to expect from ambience part of it."
41,4,  One of the best biryani s in town. always crowded and lot of Swiggy guys waiting to pick up the orders. Not much option for Veg. but surely great taste.
42,5,"d  i met few fanboys and girls of Meghna who vocally ridiculed Paradise (both Andhra 'style' biryani) and it reminded me of ManU vs Aralan, Chelsea rivalry. I realized the passion is no less here. Anyway, coming back to biryani, with Meghna packaging was bad and tacky, not only it is difficult to open (no thought there, P1, M0) but also the rice is not layered, which is essence of Biryani, it's all dumped hurriedly, P2, M0. Quality of rice is good but Paradise was better P3, M0, Biryani gravy and raita watery, P4, M0, boneless chicken minced and prepared well, P4, M1, veg biryani has nicely done aloos P4, M2. Quantity is good. Verdict: Paradise (bangalore) is more class, Meghna more mass. ?? both are great."
43,4,"  Located at koramangla 5th bock, this place is located very near to jyoti nivas college which makes it all the more crowded. Having heard allot about the place, I decided to go there on a Thursday night after work for dinner. Ordered boneless chicken biryani . the quantity is enough to fill up 2 people of medium epetite. The biryani was served hot with rayta and gravy and tasted good. However I missed the aroma and spices in the rice. The chicken pieces were well marinated and smooth . I just wish it was Lil spicy. We also ordered guntur chicken dry as starter . it was again not spicy but well cooked and tasted good. However for the price paid I found the quantity of starter to be too less. There were hardly 5-6 small boneless pieces and guntur chicken is famous for its spices that was missing. All over must try out . Amit Srivastava"
44,3.5,"  Known for their Biryanis, I went to relive the taste and it didn’t disappoint me at all. But sadly they didn’t have andhra style chilly chicken, Instead had ‘Gantur Chicken’. Value for money and quantity is good. As usual place was crowded, but luckily found a place soon enough. I think they need to improve the time taken to serve the dishes, and provide the bill. Also staffs need to be bit more polite!"
45,3,  One of my favourite pace for Hyberband biriyani the boneless chicken biriyani is outstanding nicely prepared well balanced in taste will be back soon
46,5,"  Well known for hyderabadi style hyderabadi, it caters to all types of biriyani lovers in the country. After eating the paneer biriyani in this outlet you will definitely call it a pulao because its definitely a biriyani and yummy too I had paneer biriyani and one biriyani can easily serve two people unless you have challenged your frnd to eat the whole plate alone. Meghana"
47,4.5,"ed  ohhh! heard of it from many. and to my short visit to Bengaluru i got the chance to try. and this place serves delicious biryani. Tried the egg biryani, and the quantity they serve for the price. It made me happy.?? Want to try this with an empty stomach.??"
48,4,  Meghana's special biryani is named aptly. It is very special with the special chicken on top. Great place to go each time you have a craving for Biryani. Definitely in top 3 biryani places on my list.
49,4,"  Order out any biryani and you wont be disappointed I am not a kind of person who loves biryani somehow, but then this place changes your mind and taste Chicken Biryani is their speciality Quality : 5/5 Staff : 4/5 Pocket friendly : 5/5 Ambiance : 3/5 Overall a good place for dinner"
50,4,"  What's more to write about this place, simply one of the best andhra food places for me. Went twice in the last few days. The special chicken Biryani was the thing to have. I liked it better than the Meghana spl Biryani. Also if you want to try something spicy try the chicken vepudu, just simply amazing. But the drawbacks are long wait times both for the tables and also the food. Gets pretty crowded on the weekends."
51,4.5,  Meghana is surely one of the top names in Bangalore for Biryani. The outlet is located on the perpendicular road to jyoti nivas College. Parking is a hassle but worth it for this delicious biryani. The special biryani comes with boneless pieces and a fragrant masala which leaves you wanting for more.
52,3.5,"  I had heard so much about Meghana's Biryani from my colleagues that last week I finally went to the place to have it with one of my colleagues. We ordered a plate of Prawn Biryani and Meghana Chicken 555. Here are my quick ratings - 5/5 for the food - The food served here is just perfect. There can't be any second opinion about the quality and taste of it. The chicken in the starter was tender, spicy and different from chicken 65 (i kept thinking that the item would taste something like chicken 65). The biryani was delightfully spicy and rich. The prawns were well-cooked, juicy and a good amount of it was served. One bowl of biryani is good enough for two people.   3/5 for ambience - The set up really simple and clean.   5/5 for the price: The items are well priced and it's a very pocket friendly place. 5/5 for the service: The service was prompt, and the person attending us helped us with recommendations and was also open to customizations of the dishes. Will I visit again? - Yes, absolutely! :) Follow my Instagram Page for more updates on food - @sneakpeekofmyplatter"

55,5,"  My all time favourite place to have biryani from. I love every chicken starter from their menu like, maharaja chicken, Guntur chicken dry, special 555. Everything is lip smacking tasty. And their special boneless chicken biryani is too die for, just such amazing blend of spices ,tingles my taste buds , every time I have it."
56,3,"  One of the spiciest biryanis. We ordered Vegetable biryani for takeaway. The biryani quantity was sufficient for two. It was very spicy. Except for beans, i could not find any other veggies in the biryani. The taste was good but nothing great."
57,5,"  This is an excellent place to tuck into a Hyderabadi biriyani during lunch time or dinner time! The helping is very good. So, go with a hungry stomach! The taste is authentic Hyderabadi and very good in the restaurant. But, if you order from home, they serve the biriyani rice and the chicken pieces with masala separately and that takes away the fun completely! Another thing not to do here is try boneless biriyani! Stick to the special chicken biriyani for a royale experience!"
58,5,"  There are 3 famous biryani brands in Bangalore- Kritunga, Meghana and Nagarjuna. Till now, I've repeatedly tried Kritunga biryani only. Just for a change, I went to Meghana this time. I ordered Paneer biryani with buttermilk. Biryani was awesome. Served with Raita and mirchi ka salan. The while combination was super-nice. Even the buttermilk was delicious. Ambience was okayish. Price totally worth it."
59,5,"  We ordered meghana special biriyani, Chilli prawns,fish item- day soecial,lemon soda. quality and quantity both were excellent. good place, good behavior."
60,3,"  Not a bad place but not as amazing as everyone hypes it to be. The biriyani does taste good but I just don’t feel like it’s biriyani xD Quantity-wise, they are quite generous. Ordering from here when you’re starving to death would be a great idea. I also recommend their lemon chicken!"
61,4.5,"  The Meghana Biriyani is located in kormangala,famous for its various types of biriyani.   We went for the Dinner. We Ordered Meghna Special Biriyani & Kodi Vupudu. Both were amazing in Taste. Kodi Vupudu is a good option for the spicy Lovers. Seriously Food was amazing. We didn’t wait much time for the food. Ambience is on ok side & Its always overcrowded place. Added to the list of my fav Biriyani Centres."
62,2.5,"  Took a takeaway from here, ordered two chicken briyani was not impressed at all, the biryani was just average and was way too disappointed with there packaging as well felt like I ordered two packs of atta and some masala.. Taste 3/5 Packaging 2/5 Value for money 2/5"
63,4,ated  Visited many times no changes in Menu or Changes in taste! ?? Just like the way the prepare Biryani and taste of it! ??Even starters too good to have side with Biryani and beverages like coke and Thumbsup!?? Weekends are always crowded but service is quick and kind off Full meals! ??
64,4.5,"  Located in Kormangala and the restaurant is clean and staff are really helpful. We orderd the chicken boneless biriyani . Lovedddd the biriyani. A little bit spicy. But as I love spicy food, I really enjoyed the biriyani. The rates are reasonable as well."
65,4,"  Located in a Kormangla, this place is well known for its various types of biryani and they were open late night. Service and food was good! Panner biryani is definitely recommend for the vegetarians"
66,4.5,"Rated  Meghana is like the love which hurts you but that is the only one who can provide solace to your burning heart. In one taste it might just set your taste palate on fire on the other hand make you crave more too. You can't stop eating. One of the most frequented place for me and my group of friends. One of the oldest places to dine in, their boneless chicken biriyani is the signature dish for me. Been visiting here since the last two years every now and then. Be it birthdays, or success stories meghana remains the ""constant"" in our varying reasons to celebrate. Must try mutton ghee roast too. Prawn biriyani too is amazing Highly recommended"
67,3,"  Having heard of this place in abundance , I was extremely excited to try Meghana Foods. Upon entering , we discovered that the restaurant was almost full which is a good sign for me. We ordered a Paneer Biryani for two and it was served on our table in a jiffy. We were highly impressed by the service. But as we tasted the biryani, all our excitement vanished. It was totally bland. And guess what followed, the server brought the bill in the middle of our meal. It was overly graceless. So yes, we found it supremely overrated."
68,4,"  The best Biryani I had in Bangalore. The food is a solid 5, but the ambience could bet better. The seating was not the best and it always is overcrowded."
69,4,"  Food: 4.5/5 Ambiance: 3/5 Service: 3.5/5 I'm a hardcore non vegetarian especially when it comes to Biryani but open to some experimentation for a change, I went with a friend's recommendation of their Paneer Biryani! Good lord, wasn't it heavenly?!  I've never had a Biryani so delicious that is not Non Veg. The Paneer was ample and soft, appropriately flavored. I still haven't tried anything non Veg on their menu because I'm literally stuck on their Paneer Biryani. Oh yeah, their starters are pretty sick too. Try the Manchurians - Gobi, Mushroom, Paneer - doesn't matter. All are amazing!  But yeah, I'll definitely recommend some other outlet. The Koramangala one is way too crowded and jam packed almost all the time. Gives more of a Dhaba feel than that of a restaurant!"
70,4,  Good quality rice and meat used. Even the veg dum biryani was excellent so something for vegetarians as well. The taste is quite good and service is fast. Must go for all biryani lovers
71,4.5,  The best in Bangalore..reasonable pricing and decent quantity..they take a lot of time for home delivery..it’s always over crowded at the restaurant.
72,4,"  Beat place for all the veg biryani lovers, taste is too good and spicy. Pricing wise its economical. Parking not available. Ambience is on the ok side."
73,4.5,  One the best places in Bangalore I've visited this place more than 3 times. The biryani is amazing!!! The chicken is separated from the rice is just perfect. The taste is very unique and the hit of spice is just perfect! The quantity of food served is worth its value .The place has a good seating arrangement. Would come here any number of times if given oppurtunities
74,4,"  Quick service, amazing food, no bull. Loved it. Boneless biryani not to be missed, the regular biryani is equally good too. Seated quickly, served quickly. No complaints"
75,4,  I love Meghanas Biryani! I love the fact that the chicken is separated from the rice and then you can choose to eat them together. It’s full of gnarly flavours and the chilly hit is perfect.
76,3.5,"  This Meghana biryani located is located in 5th block, koramangala. Food is as usual good here... but the sitting area seems too less on ground floor.Went here on a weekend for dinner, had to share the table with complete strangers. We requested for seat upstairs but our request went in vain. Talking about service, apart from the sitting management, it feels okayish. In food, ordered for special biryani and paneer 65, both were good."
77,4,"  Whenever we are looking for place where we can have comfort food , Meghana Foods comes to our mind. Have visited this place serveral times. They do serve one of the best veg biryanis in Bangalore. Whenever you are looking for assured quality biryani order Dum Aloo Biryani or Paneer biryani from here and you will not be dispppointed. The staff and service here is friendly & quick. The ambiance is basic and comfortable"
78,3,"  I remember a time when this used to be my favourite biryani place but when I look today it has lost its charms.  Around 2 years before this place used to quench not just the hunger but satisfy the cravings too. But not today, it has become to another Kormangala institutions there to mint money, quantities have almost become half, biryani masala has lost its touch. Raita has become watery and salan has become tasteless. Waiters were not friendly in the earlier days now they have become rude.  Food used to be excellent but now it's not the same. Now biryani has become ordinary like other Hyderabadi biryani joints. The 3 rating only for its previous glory days"
79,5,"  Best biryani hand down!! just visit, order boneless chicken biryani, pour sone of that yumm raitha all over and belt!! foodgasm: check!! TASTE 10/5. VFM: 5/5."
80,4,  Mouth watering biryani. If you are in Bangalore you should try this biryani. Make sure you have enough time because you need to wait for the table but trust me it's worth the wait!
81,5,"  A PERFECT EXPERIENCE: I looovveeeddd the biriyani here. I had my perfect start to my new year eating Meghan's biriyani. I ordered chicken boneless biriyani and mutton Keema biriyani and I had a blast having it. The taste was perfect, the aroma was perfect, the quantity was perfect, the service was perfect and the price was very affordable. Great great experience."
82,5,  Absolutely love this place... I have been visiting this place since so many years... the taste still remains the same... biriyani is awesome... mouth watering... perfect spices... best biriyani in Bangalore...
